# Bird_Mirgration_Frequency_Prediction-
We're developing a system to predict the frequency of 'Grus grus' bird based on user-provided dates. We use ML tools for time series analysis, MYSQL for data management, and Matplotlib for statistical analysis. We also explore Flask and HTML for model deployment and visualization in web browsers.
